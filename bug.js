In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't being written to Firestore despite seemingly correct code and successful authentication. The `set()` method didn't throw any errors, but the data remained absent in the database.  This happened intermittently, making debugging difficult.  The code involved multiple asynchronous operations, making it hard to pinpoint the exact timing of the failure.
